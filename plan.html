<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>the main goal of this website is to be simple and provide good knowledge about the company. so to achive this goal there are enough resources provided by the client already. By putting this resources together and making a simple website with good user interface and styles is the major goal.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>As it said in document it is a family run business and does not have much of a exposure in the market. so let me make few of the points from which this project would help their business grow</p>
<ul>
<li>As internet is most importent part of todays life. this website can help them to reach for more customers than they have right now.</li>
<li>spreading this website is easy on socal networking site is easy because one click can lead to complete information of ehat this company is all about insteed of calling or emailing them for the basic enquiries</li>
<li>If there is any kind of change its easy to spread the information through a online platform like website</li>
</ul>
<p>like this we have many more advantages which will help business to grow financially and also develop a strong network of customers</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>According to client provided information most of the current customers are between 35 to 50. But they want to get even customers from high school and even adults
so for this assignment the target audiance are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>High school students</li>
<li>Adults</li>
<li>Elders</li>
</ul>
<p>But the major target audiance are between the ages of 15 to 30 because there are very rare customers from these age groups</p>
